# Project Title

GPA Calculator Using Python

## Description

The "GPA Calculator Using Python" is a Python script that calculates the average grade for a student based on their marks in four different subjects: Bangla, English, Math, and Science. This script allows users to input their marks for each subject, calculates the average marks, and then determines the corresponding grade based on a predefined grading scale.


## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter their marks for each of the four subjects: Bangla, English, Math, and Science.

2. The script calculates the total marks obtained by summing up the marks in these four subjects.

3. The average marks are calculated by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects (in this case, 4).

4. The script then uses a grading scale to determine the grade corresponding to the average marks. The grading scale includes letter grades such as A+, A, B, C, D, and F, with specific 
   mark ranges for each grade.

5. Finally, the script displays the calculated average grade to the user based on their input marks.


## Note

1. The grading scale used in this script is a simple example and can be customized to match the grading system used by a particular educational institution.
2. Users should ensure that they input valid marks within the appropriate range to get an accurate grade calculation.
